A very lightly modified Kinoite build for my laptop and dev workflows.

Features:
* Layered on top of [ublue-os/kinoite-main](https://github.com/ublue-os/main/pkgs/container/kinoite-main)
* lots of my favoriate utilities and programming langauges, see [](build_files/packages.txt)
* ready-to-use virtualization
* `zsh` is the default shell with vim mode
* a few default dotfiles

See the template's [README](docs/README.md) for more info.
